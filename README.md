## About Me  

Hey, I’m Mike. I work in information security at the **New York State Office of Information Technology Services**, helping to secure state systems and data. My interest in tech started young, watching my dad work on computers, which eventually led me to pursue a **B.S. in Cybersecurity** at the **University at Albany, SUNY**. While there, I was involved in the **Cyber Defense Organization (CDO)** and **IEEE**, gaining hands-on experience and making connections in the field.  

Outside of work, I enjoy:  
🎸 Playing guitar  
⛰️ Hiking in the Adirondacks  
⚾ Watching baseball  
🖥️ Experimenting with homelab projects
